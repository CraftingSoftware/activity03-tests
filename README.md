# Test Coverage and Parametrized Tests

## Referring to the [pytest-cov documentation](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#overview), what are the steps to reporting statement coverage for pytest tests?

TODO

## What statement coverage do we get and why?

TODO

## What happens to the statement coverage if you comment out the last two tests in `test_area.py` and why?

TODO

## Referring to [pytest-cov documentationâ€™s reference section](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#reference), how can we report branch coverage?

TODO

## What branch coverage do we get and why?

TODO

## What happens to the branch coverage if you comment out the `test_square_negative_raises_valueerror` test and why?

TODO

## Referring to the same reference section and the [Reporting page](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reporting.html), how can we list the line numbers of the lines of code that were not covered?

TODO

## What lines of code are not covered?

TODO

## Referring to the [Taskipy documentation](https://github.com/illBeRoy/taskipy#general), how can we use Taskipy to more easily run tests with statement and branch coverages and missing line numbers?

TODO

## What is parametrized testing and when do we want to use it?

TODO

## In `test_area.py`, how can we use parametrized testing to make our tests more concise?

TODO

## Referring to page 44 of [Python Testing with pytest](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FY-JPjZe1BXUdC0ebKvJfsWIdNS0yRUM/view?usp=sharing), write a parameterized test for the `square` function.

TODO

## What do you see when you add a `-v` to the `test` task in `pyproject.toml`?

TODO

## Referring to pages 45 - 47 of [Python Testing with pytest](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FY-JPjZe1BXUdC0ebKvJfsWIdNS0yRUM/view?usp=sharing), how can we add an identifier for each set of input values?
